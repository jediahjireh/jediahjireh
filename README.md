### ｡･ﾟﾟ･ welcome! ･ﾟﾟ･｡

I’m a multipotentialite with a knack for all things tech. I enjoy building – websites, crafts, ideas, self-esteem, you name it! My strong appreciation for art in all its forms has cultivated my keen eye for detail. I channel my creativity through problem-solving and have my critical thinking do the sculpting.

Professionally, I’m a full-stack developer. I’ve learnt and grown a lot in quite a short time. Every day, I tackle challenges that push my limits and I genuinely enjoy what I do! Software is my field of choice (please do not ask me to fix your WiFi router 0_0).

Developing scalable applications with responsive and intuitive interfaces, through clean, maintainable code are my ABCs. Staying updated with industry trends to keep my skills sharp, testing, debugging, contributing to team workflows and processes? Second nature. 

If there’s one thing that living and breathing development has taught me, it’s that setting aside time to just dance it out is a necessity 💃 (if Cristina and Meredith’s resilience hadn't been testament enough). That, coupled with setting aside a few minutes to read the docs, rather than spending days bug-fixing is guaranteed to save you from a crash-out here and there.

My true passion lies in anti-trafficking work. Standing in the gap for those who require aid and then going on to assist in empowering them to stand strong is a mission that I ardently pursue. I hope to one day fully dedicate my time and skills to this.

In short, I’m a developer with a heart for impactful work.

👩‍💻ྀིྀིྀིྀིྀི happy coding!
