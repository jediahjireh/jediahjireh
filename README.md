### 🌐 Debugging the World:
The intersection of technology and social impact can drive meaningful change. Beyond building cutting-edge applications, my true passion lies in using my skills to combat social injustice. My primary goal is to leverage my skills in order to make a tangible difference in the world. My dream is to contribute my abilities to the fight against the heinous crime of human trafficking, using technology to empower anti-trafficking organisations and to aid them in the mission to rescue and support survivors.

### 🔭 Looking Ahead:
I strive to establish myself as a proficient software engineer/web developer in the industry. Whether it's creating innovative web solutions, optimising user experiences or developing scalable applications and platforms, I’m driven to bring about meaningful change.

### 💻 Lifelong Learner:
The realm of technology is ever-evolving and I'm committed to staying at the forefront of advancements. Such as the journey of life, the journey of someone in the tech industry is anchored in continuous learning and development, which I embrace. It is an integral part of my growth as a developer and I welcome challenges that push me to constantly refine my craft.

### 🫧 Fun Fact:
The first computer "bug" was an actual bug - a moth to be precise.
